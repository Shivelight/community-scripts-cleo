## Changes

### 2022-08-17

- Fix player can't leave Ammu-Nation during Doberman mission. Although, this will allow player to enter Ammu-Nation (AMMUN4) from the start.
- Fix 0x49646550 exception crash by moving the global variables object rather than destroying it.
- Restore objects position and garage door before saving to avoid stuck objects / bad save.
- Remove Doherty garage control, now it will always open for easier restoration and because I never use it. It also fix where the garage would close when a mission ends. *

\* <sub>I can add the control back if there is a lot of demand.</sub>
